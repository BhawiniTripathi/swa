<ul>
<li>Assurance is a reasoned, audit-able argument created to support claimed beliefs about a certain entity</li>
<li>This course is an intersection of knowledge areas necessary to perform engineering activities relevant for promoting assurance in claims for <code>Secure Software</code>.</li>
<li>This course takes on a software development lifecycle perspective for the prevention of flaws.</li>

<h3>
<a id="instruction" class="anchor" href="#instruction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instruction</h3>

<ul>
<li>The course will be conducted through “discussions” and “trying things out”.</li>
<li>There will be many class-exercises in small groups. </li>
<li>Familiarity with reading materials will be assessed using in-class quizzes. Students must complete assignments and independent projects as directed. </li>

<a id="policy-on-plagiarism" class="anchor" href="#policy-on-plagiarism" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Policy on Plagiarism</h3>

<p>Any exam or assignment material submitted which looks identical in any fashion to another student’s work or external sources will be considered plagiarism. The grade of which will be adjusted to the minimum possible (Zero) for the assignment for all parties involved. Any further offenses will result in an “F” for the course, accompanied by academic dishonesty actions taken by the College Dean. Note carefully the University policy on academic integrity (<a href="http://goo.gl/NVWUBy">http://goo.gl/NVWUBy</a>; <a href="https://goo.gl/JHfZWW">https://goo.gl/JHfZWW</a>) and code of conduct (<a href="http://goo.gl/Ar8Bda">http://goo.gl/Ar8Bda</a>).<br>
Make yourself familiar with writing techniques such that you can cite external sources without plagiarizing. Here is are a few links to writing resources: <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/01/">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/01/</a> <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/01/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/01/</a></p>

<a id="exams" class="anchor" href="#exams" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be a mid term exam, and a final exam. The exams will consist of essay-type questions with only a few multiple choices type questions. These in-class exams are intended to help focus on the important parts in the material, reinforce learning, and provide timely feedback. The exam questions typically have multiple parts, be sure you answer all the parts.</p>

<h3>
<a id="in-class-exercises" class="anchor" href="#in-class-exercises" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In-class Exercises</h3>

<p>In-class exercises will be conducted in stages that correspond to the software development lifecycle. The objective of assignments is to gain hands-on experience in various techniques and tools for software assurance and apply them to build secure software. Details about the assignments will follow as we go further into the semester. Special software programs/tools will be provided to you for some of the assignments. The instructions to turn in the assignment will be provided along with each the assignments. </p>

<a id="course-meeting-schedule" class="anchor" href="#course-meeting-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Meeting Schedule</h3>

<p>In this semester there are scheduled ~16 available class periods on Wednesdays for 135 minutes each. Accounting for in-class exams, project presentations, snow days, instructor travel to conferences and the like we will actually have something closer to 10-11 class periods for instruction. </p>

<p>Due to the current and advanced nature of this class, it is under constant revision! So you can expect some experimentation and shuffling of the course topics as we progress through the semester. Constructive feedback on the content is highly encouraged.</p>

<h3>
<a id="book-keeping" class="anchor" href="#book-keeping" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Book Keeping</h3>

<p>Put your name, date and class identification and page number on all your assignments and any correspondence with me. All email sent to me regarding the class must have the class descriptor and your name in the subject field e.g. (IASC/CSCI 8420 - TOPIC). We will be using blackboard for the course.</p>
