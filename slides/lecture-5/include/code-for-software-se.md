class: middle
# Building Abstractions
## .red[Vulnerabilities] in code are language, product or environment specific
- Dictionary is appropriate

## .orange[Weaknesses] span a range of languages, products and environments
- Taxonomy is appropriate

# Building Abstractions

## Commonalities and differences in "Errors"
- Which class of weaknesses to address first?
- What are the related weaknesses in an attack vector?
- What are the known/reusable mitigations?

# Learning from .red[Errors]

## The Landwehr Software Flaw Taxonomy (1993)
- Genesis, Location, Time of introduction


## Several recent efforts have followed
- Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, PLOVER, 19 Deadly Sins, OWASP top tenâ€¦

## The Common Weaknesses Enumeration [(CWE)](http://cwe.mitre.org)
- Assimilates and advances categorization efforts

# CWE Types
### Weakness Class: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
- Abstract, independent of any specific language or technology

### Weakness Base: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)
- Abstract, sufficient details to infer specific methods for detection and prevention

### Weakness Variant: [CWE-85](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/85.html)
- Detailed, limited to a specific language or technology.

### Weakness Category: [CWE-990](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/990.html)
- A set of other entries that share a common characteristic

# Finding the best CWE
## Guidance
- Map to a Weakness only
- .red[DO NOT] map to Categories or Views
- Map at the lowest abstraction level possible

# CWE Prioritization

## Technical Impacts of Software Weaknesses:
- Read data  
- Modify data  
- Denial-of-Service: unreliable execution  
- Denial-of-Service: resource consumption  
- Execute unauthorized code or commands  
- Gain privileges / assume identity  
- Bypass protection mechanism  
- Hide activities  

## Top CWE lists
- [CWE/SANS Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html)
- Scoring mechanisms: [CWSS](https://cwe.mitre.org/cwss/index.html), [CWRAF](https://cwe.mitre.org/cwraf/index.html)
